	    		<hr>
	    		<p>For this project, I worked in a team of two with the company Seeda to develop a front-end website for their SeeRem division. The objective of the project was to design and build a functioning website for SeeRem to allow their customers to learn more about their service and to connect with their sales team. By communicating with the company, I was able to learn more about the service they were offering to help my partner and I better design for the intended purpose of the website. The end product was a fully developed front-end responsive website to promote SeeRem, an application that allows teams working in remote worksites to connect with one another.</p>

	    		<h3>Ideation & Style Guide</h3>
	    		<p>During the first month of the project, I began creating wireframes and a style guide for the SeeRem website. The style guide consisted of designing the basic structure and elements that would be incorporated into the site which would help my partner and I keep a consistent design and code structure on all the web pages. This stage also included understanding the branding of the company and how it would be represented through the website. </p>

	    		<h3>Website Development</h3>
	    		<p>Development of the website began in the second month, where I started creating template pages using HTML and CSS. Throughout the weeks, we began refining the layout of the overall site by compiling content, images, and deciding on the overall flow that would create a positive user experience. JavaScript was also used in the site to increase the functionality, such as having a scroll to top and confirmation messages.</p>

	    		<h3>Challenge of Responsiveness</h3>
	    		<p>Once the structure of the website was developed, I had to ensure that the site was responsive so that it can be viewed on various different device screen sizes, including mobile. This was one of the more challenging tasks of the project as it was my first time developing a website that would be fully responsive. Making the website work well for mobile devices proved to be very hard as the screen size was a lot smaler in comparison to a desktop screen size. However, through the use of media queries, I was able to make the elements of the page more appropriate for a smaller screen size.</p>

	    		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	    		<p>Overall, the whole process took two months and the website was coded to be responsive on a variety of devices and browsers. Although we were able to showcase the necessary information to promote SeeRem on a front-end website, I would like to explore the possibility of developing the back-end portion of the site in the future to handle the data provided by the visitors of the website. Using the experience from this project, I would spend more time considering how future website projects would look on mobile to make the process of implementing responsiveness easier. The final website was then submitted to the company, where it received a positive review from Seeda.</p>
