			        	<p>I am a Surrey based web developer and UX/UI designer that is currently studying Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University. With a strong interest in web development and interface design, I hope to create a positive user experience through the work I produce by combining my interest in coding and design. My goal is to utilize my skills in front-end and back-end web development as well as my design knowledge to create meaningful applications ranging from the web to mobile that can meet the needs of the intended users.</p>

			        	<h3>Project One: SeeRem Website</h3>
			        	<p>For this project, I worked in a team of two with the company Seeda to develop a front-end website for their SeeRem division. The objective of the project was to design and build a functioning website for SeeRem to allow their customers to learn more about their service and to connect with their sales team. By communicating with the company, I was able to learn more about the service they were offering to help my partner and I better design for the intended purpose of the website. The end product was a fully developed front-end responsive website to promote SeeRem, an application that allows teams working in remote worksites to connect with one another.</p>
						<p>During the first month of the project, I began creating wireframes and a style guide for the SeeRem website. The style guide consisted of designing the basic structure and elements that would be incorporated into the site which would help my partner and I keep a consistent design and code structure on all the web pages. This stage also included understanding the branding of the company and how it would be represented through the website.</p>
						<p>Development of the website began in the second month, where I started creating template pages using HTML and CSS. Throughout the weeks, we began refining the layout of the overall site by compiling content, images, and deciding on the overall flow that would create a positive user experience. JavaScript was also used in the site to increase the functionality, such as having a scroll to top and confirmation messages.</p>
						<p>Once the structure of the website was developed, I had to ensure that the site was responsive so that it can be viewed on various different device screen sizes, including mobile. This was one of the more challenging tasks of the project as it was my first time developing a website that would be fully responsive. Making the website work well for mobile devices proved to be very hard as the screen size was a lot smaller in comparison to a desktop screen size. However, through the use of media queries, I was able to make the elements of the page more appropriate for a smaller screen size.</p>
						<p>Overall, the whole process took two months and the website was coded to be responsive on a variety of devices and browsers. Although we were able to showcase the necessary information to promote SeeRem on a front-end website, I would like to explore the possibility of developing the back-end portion of the site in the future to handle the data provided by the visitors of the website. Using the experience from this project, I would spend more time considering how future website projects would look on mobile to make the process of implementing responsiveness easier. The final website was then submitted to the company, where it received a positive review from Seeda.</p>

			        	<h3>Project Two: Shoe Addiction Website</h3>
			        	<p>Shoe Addiction is a fictional shoe store web application project, focused on the back-end handling of user requests. The goal of the project is to create a website that would be able to handle user input and utilize a database to store and retrieve data. The website was developed in a team of three to display products offered by the store through a database, allow visitors to browse content units, and can handle member registration, log in as well as customization. The overall functionality and idea of the website was inspired by current e-commerce sites.</p>
			        	<p>Starting with the database design, an ER Diagram was created to understand what information needed to be stored on the site to handle the intended functionality. Three main entities with their respective attributes and relations were created; Members, Products, and Cart. Once the diagram was finalized, the database was created.</p>
			        	<p>The next step of the project was front-end development, where I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a basic structure for the website based on the wireframes that we designed. Images and content were added and the branding was constructed to create a comprehensive user interface.</p>
			        	<p>Our focus then shifted to back-end development where I used PHP and MySQL to process user and database information. Users had the ability to browse the shoes that were retrieved from the database and through the use of PHP form handling and MySQL query statements, visitors had the ability to sign up for an account or log in to the site using a pre-existing account. The website is able to check the database to see if the user has inputted the correct information when trying to log in and will then allow them to add items to their favourites list and cart. With the different abilities that visitors and members have on the site, PHP sessions were implemented to check if a user is logged in.</p>
			        	<p>Since this was the first time I worked with PHP and MySQL to develop a website that was focused primarily on back-end development, it was challenging to get the functionality of the site working at each phase. It took a lot of time to debug certain issues in our code. However, by dedicating more time to learning and understanding each topic, I was able to figure out the issues that we had and got the final website working with our intended functionality. </p>
			        	<p>Overall, the development of the website took three months to complete. As it was outside of the scope of the project, for future iterations I would like to explore the possibility of implementing responsiveness for the website to be compatible with a range of devices. It would also be nice to implement the purchase process to complete the full e-commerce experience. The final outcome was a fully developed website that had both front-end and back-end implemented that successfully used a database to handle the website’s information.</p>
