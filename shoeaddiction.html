	    		<hr>
	    		<p>Shoe Addiction is a fictional shoe store web application project, focused on the back-end handling of user requests. The goal of the project is to create a website that would be able to handle user input and utilize a database to store and retrieve data. The website was developed in a team of three to display products offered by the store through a database, allow visitors to browse content units, and can handle member registration, log in as well as customization. The overall functionality and idea of the website was inspired by current e-commerce sites.</p>

	    		<h3>Database Design</h3>
	    		<p>Starting with the database design, an ER Diagram was created to understand what information needed to be stored on the site to handle the intended functionality. Three main entities with their respective attributes and relations were created; Members, Products, and Cart. Once the diagram was finalized, the database was created.</p>

	    		<h3>Front-End Development</h3>
	    		<p>The next step of the project was front-end development, where I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a basic structure for the website based on the wireframes that we designed. Images and content were added and the branding was constructed to create a comprehensive user interface.</p>

	    		<h3>Back-End Implementation</h3>
	    		<p>Our focus then shifted to back-end development where I used PHP and MySQL to process user and database information. Users had the ability to browse the shoes that were retrieved from the database and through the use of PHP form handling and MySQL query statements, visitors had the ability to sign up for an account or log in to the site using a pre-existing account. The website is able to check the database to see if the user has inputted the correct information when trying to log in and will then allow them to add items to their favourites list and cart. With the different abilities that visitors and members have on the site, PHP sessions were implemented to check if a user is logged in.</p>

	    		<h3>Challenges of New Languages</h3>
	    		<p>Since this was the first time I worked with PHP and MySQL to develop a website that was focused primarily on back-end development, it was challenging to get the functionality of the site working at each phase. It took a lot of time to debug certain issues in our code. However, by dedicating more time to learning and understanding each topic, I was able to figure out the issues that we had and got the final website working with our intended functionality. </p>

	    		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	    		<p>Overall, the development of the website took three months to complete. As it was outside of the scope of the project, for future iterations I would like to explore the possibility of implementing responsiveness for the website to be compatible with a range of devices. It would also be nice to implement the purchase process to complete the full e-commerce experience. The final outcome was a fully developed website that had both front-end and back-end implemented that successfully used a database to handle the website’s information. </p>
